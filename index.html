        <h2>Goals For The Class</h2>
        <p>
          Some of my personal goals for this class are to expand my skillset, to
          learn something new, to challenge myself, and to get a firm grasp on
          the basics of web development. But most of all, I'm hoping to find a
          career in this field.

          <h2>Concerns For The Class</h2>
          <p>
            However I am not without my doubts. I'm worried that I have too
            little knowledge to succeed in this. I have no problem working with
            computers, but this is an aspect that is foreign to me. It's as if
            I'm learning a whole new language, and I did not do well in high
            school spanish. However, I just need to drive myself to do the work,
            put in the time, and not procrastinate, which is another thing I worry
            about doing.
